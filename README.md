What is a card, exactly? Well, they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, but common cards will include information or content such as a title, a user name, a picture, and various icons. Sometimes there might be a brief amount of text, for example, product or client description.

Today in this video, I’ll share with you this Code (Profile Card UI Design with Click Rotate Animation). At first, on the webpage,  there is only an image with round border color. But when you click on that corner button, the card's height and width smoothly rotate and show the contents of the card. 

If you’re feeling difficulty understanding what I am saying. You can watch a full video tutorial on this code
